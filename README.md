🚀 Project Milestones
Milestone 1: Core App (Local)
✅ Goal: Have a working app + DB locally.
    • Features:
        ○ User can add a project (e.g., “DevOps Learning”).
        ○ Add milestones (title, description, status: Todo/In Progress/Done).
        ○ View progress dashboard (e.g., % completed).
    • Stack:
        ○ Backend: FastAPI (Python) or Express.js (Node).
        ○ DB: PostgreSQL (via docker-compose).
        ○ Frontend: Simple React (with Tailwind).
    • Deliverable: App runs with docker-compose up.

Milestone 2: Containerization
✅ Goal: Run the app in Docker.
    • Write Dockerfile for backend + frontend.
    • Update docker-compose.yml to use images.
    • Test locally with containers only.

Milestone 3: CI/CD with GitHub Actions
✅ Goal: Automated builds & pushes.
    • Create workflow:
        ○ Run tests.
        ○ Build & push images to DockerHub (later → AWS ECR).
    • Add badges (build status) to your repo.
    • Deliverable: Every push to main builds & pushes new Docker image.

Milestone 4: Infrastructure as Code (Terraform)
✅ Goal: Provision cloud infra for CI/CD.
    • Use Terraform to:
        ○ Create ECR repo (for images).
        ○ Create IAM role for GitHub Actions.
    • Deliverable: CI/CD now pushes to AWS ECR instead of DockerHub.

Milestone 5: Kubernetes (Local)
✅ Goal: Run your SaaS app in a local k8s cluster.
    • Set up kind or minikube.
    • Write k8s manifests:
        ○ Deployment (backend, frontend).
        ○ Service (ClusterIP for DB, NodePort/Ingress for frontend/backend).
        ○ ConfigMaps + Secrets (DB creds).
    • Deliverable: App accessible at http://localhost:3000.

Milestone 6: GitOps with ArgoCD
✅ Goal: Automate k8s deployments.
    • Install ArgoCD in your cluster.
    • Create separate GitOps repo with manifests.
    • Configure ArgoCD to sync that repo.
    • Deliverable: Pushing YAML → Argo updates cluster automatically.

Milestone 7: Cloud Deployment
✅ Goal: Deploy to cloud k8s.
    • Use Terraform to create an EKS cluster (or DigitalOcean/GKE if simpler).
    • Point ArgoCD at cloud cluster.
    • Deliverable: Your app is live on the internet 🌍

Milestone 8: Security
✅ Goal: Add security best practices.
    • Add container scanning (Trivy) in CI.
    • Store secrets properly (k8s secrets, or sealed-secrets).
    • Restrict IAM permissions for CI/CD.
    • Deliverable: Security checks integrated in CI.

Milestone 9: Observability
✅ Goal: Add monitoring/logging.
    • Install Prometheus + Grafana for metrics.
    • Install Loki/EFK for logs.
    • Add dashboards for app + cluster health.
    • Deliverable: Grafana dashboard shows your app’s progress data + k8s metrics.

Milestone 10: SaaS Features (Stretch Goal)
✅ Goal: Make it a real SaaS app.
    • User accounts + authentication (Supabase/Auth0).
    • Multi-project support.
    • Stripe subscriptions (free vs paid users).
Invite teammates to track projects together.
