# 🚀 DevOps Tracker🚀 Project Milestones

Milestone 1: Core App (Local)

A comprehensive project milestone tracking application that demonstrates modern DevOps practices and cloud-native technologies.✅ Goal: Have a working app + DB locally.

    • Features:

## 🎯 Project Overview        ○ User can add a project (e.g., “DevOps Learning”).

        ○ Add milestones (title, description, status: Todo/In Progress/Done).

This application allows users to track project milestones and progress, built with a modern stack and deployed using industry-standard DevOps practices. The project serves as a practical learning journey through the entire DevOps ecosystem.        ○ View progress dashboard (e.g., % completed).

    • Stack:

## 🏗️ Architecture        ○ Backend: FastAPI (Python) or Express.js (Node).

        ○ DB: PostgreSQL (via docker-compose).

- **Backend**: FastAPI (Python)        ○ Frontend: Simple React (with Tailwind).

- **Frontend**: React with Tailwind CSS    • Deliverable: App runs with docker-compose up.

- **Database**: PostgreSQL

- **Containerization**: Docker & Docker ComposeMilestone 2: Containerization

- **Orchestration**: Kubernetes✅ Goal: Run the app in Docker.

- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions    • Write Dockerfile for backend + frontend.

- **Infrastructure**: Terraform (AWS)    • Update docker-compose.yml to use images.

- **GitOps**: ArgoCD    • Test locally with containers only.

- **Monitoring**: Prometheus & Grafana

Milestone 3: CI/CD with GitHub Actions

## 📋 Project Milestones✅ Goal: Automated builds & pushes.

    • Create workflow:

### Milestone 1: Core App (Local) ✅        ○ Run tests.

**Goal**: Have a working app + DB locally        ○ Build & push images to DockerHub (later → AWS ECR).

    • Add badges (build status) to your repo.

**Features**:    • Deliverable: Every push to main builds & pushes new Docker image.

- User can add a project (e.g., "DevOps Learning")

- Add milestones (title, description, status: Todo/In Progress/Done)Milestone 4: Infrastructure as Code (Terraform)

- View progress dashboard (e.g., % completed)✅ Goal: Provision cloud infra for CI/CD.

    • Use Terraform to:

**Stack**:        ○ Create ECR repo (for images).

- Backend: FastAPI (Python) or Express.js (Node)        ○ Create IAM role for GitHub Actions.

- DB: PostgreSQL (via docker-compose)    • Deliverable: CI/CD now pushes to AWS ECR instead of DockerHub.

- Frontend: Simple React (with Tailwind)

Milestone 5: Kubernetes (Local)

**Deliverable**: App runs with `docker-compose up`✅ Goal: Run your SaaS app in a local k8s cluster.

    • Set up kind or minikube.

### Milestone 2: Containerization ✅    • Write k8s manifests:

**Goal**: Run the app in Docker        ○ Deployment (backend, frontend).

        ○ Service (ClusterIP for DB, NodePort/Ingress for frontend/backend).

**Tasks**:        ○ ConfigMaps + Secrets (DB creds).

- Write Dockerfile for backend + frontend    • Deliverable: App accessible at http://localhost:3000.

- Update docker-compose.yml to use images

- Test locally with containers onlyMilestone 6: GitOps with ArgoCD

✅ Goal: Automate k8s deployments.

### Milestone 3: CI/CD with GitHub Actions ✅    • Install ArgoCD in your cluster.

**Goal**: Automated builds & pushes    • Create separate GitOps repo with manifests.

    • Configure ArgoCD to sync that repo.

**Tasks**:    • Deliverable: Pushing YAML → Argo updates cluster automatically.

- Create workflow:

  - Run testsMilestone 7: Cloud Deployment

  - Build & push images to DockerHub (later → AWS ECR)✅ Goal: Deploy to cloud k8s.

- Add badges (build status) to your repo    • Use Terraform to create an EKS cluster (or DigitalOcean/GKE if simpler).

    • Point ArgoCD at cloud cluster.

**Deliverable**: Every push to main builds & pushes new Docker image    • Deliverable: Your app is live on the internet 🌍



### Milestone 4: Infrastructure as Code (Terraform) ✅Milestone 8: Security

**Goal**: Provision cloud infra for CI/CD✅ Goal: Add security best practices.

    • Add container scanning (Trivy) in CI.

**Tasks**:    • Store secrets properly (k8s secrets, or sealed-secrets).

- Use Terraform to:    • Restrict IAM permissions for CI/CD.

  - Create ECR repo (for images)    • Deliverable: Security checks integrated in CI.

  - Create IAM role for GitHub Actions

Milestone 9: Observability

**Deliverable**: CI/CD now pushes to AWS ECR instead of DockerHub✅ Goal: Add monitoring/logging.

    • Install Prometheus + Grafana for metrics.

### Milestone 5: Kubernetes (Local) ✅    • Install Loki/EFK for logs.

**Goal**: Run your SaaS app in a local k8s cluster    • Add dashboards for app + cluster health.

    • Deliverable: Grafana dashboard shows your app’s progress data + k8s metrics.

**Tasks**:

- Set up kind or minikubeMilestone 10: SaaS Features (Stretch Goal)

- Write k8s manifests:✅ Goal: Make it a real SaaS app.

  - Deployment (backend, frontend)    • User accounts + authentication (Supabase/Auth0).

  - Service (ClusterIP for DB, NodePort/Ingress for frontend/backend)    • Multi-project support.

  - ConfigMaps + Secrets (DB creds)    • Stripe subscriptions (free vs paid users).

Invite teammates to track projects together.
**Deliverable**: App accessible at http://localhost:3000
